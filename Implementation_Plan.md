# Phase 2: Authentication and Core Functionality

## Implementation Plan

### 2. Create Family Management - COMPLETE

---

### 1. Review Database Schema & Data Requirements

- **Objective**: Confirm that the table structure for family data (such as family name, owner ID, child members, etc.) supports all planned features.
- **Actions**:
  - Check the Supabase schema to ensure fields for the family entity exist (e.g., "families" table).
  - Verify relationships between `families` and `family_members`.
  - Make sure row-level security or policies are ready for CRUD operations.

---

### 2. Update/Verify Backend Methods

- **Objective**: Ensure you have queries/mutations to manage families and their members.
- **Actions**:
  - If an existing Supabase service or data-access file is in use (e.g., a hook like `useFamilyData`), **add or modify** methods to create, read, update, and delete family records.
  - Confirm each method uses proper error handling and returns strongly typed data (e.g., interfaces or types in TypeScript).
- **Note**: If you're unsure about how these queries need to integrate with existing code, pause and ask for clarifications.

---

### 3. Add Family Management Logic to an Existing Context

- **Objective**: Provide a clear, global way to manage family state.
- **Actions**:
  - Locate any existing global contexts (e.g., `AuthContext` or a separate `FamilyContext` if it already exists).
  - Extend that context to handle:
    - Retrieving the active family's details.
    - Adding new members (children) to the family.
    - Editing or removing existing members.
  - Maintain minimal local states; prefer storing persistent data in the context or React Query.

---

### 4. Extend the Parent Dashboard or Settings Page for Family Management

- **Objective**: Reuse an existing page or dashboard to host new family-management UI.
- **Actions**:
  - Identify the best place (e.g., "Settings" page or "Parent Dashboard") to add an interface for:
    - Creating a new family (if not already created).
    - Inviting or adding children.
    - Listing/removing members.
  - Plan a section or tab for these new features.
  - Reuse existing form components and layout patterns to ensure consistency.

---

### 5. Implement UI Controls for Family Creation/Modification

- **Objective**: Provide forms and lists for family data within the existing page or dashboard.
- **Actions**:
  - If there is a generic form component available, **modify** it to include fields specific to family creation (e.g., family name).
  - For member management, integrate a simple list or table to display existing children. Add or remove rows based on user actions.
  - Keep the UI consistent with existing design, using the same styling and layout.

---

### 6. Integrate Data Fetching and Mutations

- **Objective**: Ensure the UI is fully connected to the backend.
- **Actions**:
  - Use React Query (if already used throughout the project) or whichever data library is standard in this codebase.
  - On form submission, call the **newly added or updated** Supabase methods to create/modify families.
  - On load, fetch existing family data and display it in the UI.
  - Handle loading states, error states, and success notifications following existing project patterns.

---

### 7. Test and Validate Family Management

- **Objective**: Confirm each feature works as intended and fits project best practices.
- **Actions**:
  - **Unit Test:**
    - Test your data-fetching/mutation hooks or functions in isolation.
    - Check that each returns the correct data or error states.
  - **Integration Test:**
    - Use the user flow to create a family, add children, remove a child, and verify the results in the database.
  - **UI Test:**
    - Inspect the new or updated dashboard page. Confirm the UI updates, error handling, and success messages match project standards.

---

### 8. Final Review and Cleanup

- **Objective**: Align with project coding and style guidelines, and remove any unused code.
- **Actions**:
  - Validate code formatting (e.g., `npm run format`) and run lint checks.
  - Make sure to remove any debug logs or placeholder code.
  - Confirm that all new logic and UI remain consistent with existing naming conventions and theme usage.

**This plan ensures that each step is small, focused, and aligns with good React practices.** If you encounter any uncertainties (e.g., file structure, existing hooking logic, or naming conventions), pause and seek clarification before proceeding to the next step.
